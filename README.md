# GeoGraPE

### The Geographic Grapher of Property & Equity

These are the guts of a website I did some time ago to map, graph, and analyze
property transactions.

As I was learning a great deal about coding while and by doing this, and it was
by far the largest project I'd worked on at the time, I do not vouch for the
quality of the code.  The server side Perl code looks OK, although I would not
take the CGI/Perl/MySQL approach were I to tackle the problem today.
Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the Javascript.  It's a few thousand
lines of spaghetti.

You can play with a semi-working version of the website at 
[http://www.geogrape.net]().  It's missing a few database files, so maps won't
generate.  Pie charts and graphs will, however.
